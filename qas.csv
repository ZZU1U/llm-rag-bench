51738,"So, we know that Python uses a reference system, in order to refer to values in a list. So, if we create a new variable=list[index], the variable points to that list index. But what about when we are slicing a new list? Does the new sliced list use pointers? Or is it a new list in itself?",Does Python use pointers when creating a new sliced list?,"A list in Python is made of an array of references (plus some bookkeeping data). Slicing allocates a new array, but those copied references still point to the same heap objects.
When you do variable=list[index], the variable does not point to the list index. Rather, it references the same object that the list does at that index (at the time it is looked up; they can be changed independently later)."

41666,"We have a spark job running which consumes data from kafka stream , do some analytics and store the result.
Since data is consumed as they are produced to kafka, if we want to get 

count for the whole day,    count for an hour,      average for the whole
  day

that is not possible with this approach. Is there any way which we should follow to accomplish such requirement
Appreciate any help
Thanks and Regards
Raaghu.K",spark consume from stream -- considering data for longer period,"Your streaming job is not supposed to calculate the Daily count/Avg.
Approach 1 :
You can store the data consumer from Kafka into a persistent storage like DB/HBase/HDFS , and then you can run Daily batch which will calculate all the statistics for you like Daily count or avg.
Approach 2 :
In order to get that information form streaming itself you need to use Accumulators which will hold the record count,sum. and calculate avg according.
Approach 3 :
Use streaming window, but holding data for a day doesn't make any sense. If you need 5/10 min avg, you can use this.
I think the first method is preferable as it will give you more flexibility to calculate all the analytics you want."

3514,Is there anyway to discover the python value of a PyObject* from a corefile in gdb,Accessing Python Objects in a Core Dump,"It's lots of work, but of course it can be done, especially if you have all the symbols. Look at the header files for the specific version of Python (and compilation options in use to build it): they define PyObject as a struct which includes, first and foremost, a pointer to a type. Lots of macros are used, so you may want to run the compile of that Python from sources again, with exactly the same flags but in addition a -E to stop after preprocessing, so you can refer to the specific C code that made the bits you're seeing in the core dump.
A type object has, among many other things, a string (array of char) that's its name, and from it you can infer what exactly objects of that type contain -- be it content directly, or maybe some content (such as a length, i.e. number of items) and a pointer to the actual data.
I've done such super-advanced post-mortem debugging a couple of times (starting with VERY precise knowledge of the Python versions involved and all the prepared preprocessed sources &c) and each time it took me a day or two (were I still a freelance and charging by the hour, if I had to bid on such a task I'd say at least 20 hours -- at my not-cheap hourly rates!-).
IOW, it's worth it only if it's really truly the only way out of some very costly pickle. On the plus side, it WILL teach you more about Python's internals than you ever thought was there, even after memorizing every line of the sources.  Good luck, you'll need some!!!"

54799,"So as the title suggests, my question is whether feature selection algorithms are independent of the regression/classification model chosen. Maybe some feature selection algorithms are independent and some are not? If so can you name a few of each kind? Thanks.",Is feature selection agnostic to regression/classification model chosen?,"It depends on the algorithm you use to select features.  Filter methods that are done prior to modeling are of course agnostic, as they're using statistical methods like chi-squared or correlation coefficient to get rid of unnecessary features.
If you use embedded methods where features are selected during model creation, it is possible that different models will find value in different feature sets.  Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression are a few examples of these. 
It's worth noting that some model types perform well with sparse data or missing values while others do not."

38266,"I'm using Python's non-parametric tests to check whether two samples are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying parent populations: scipy.stats.ks_2samp (2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov), scipy.stats.anderson_ksamp (Anderson-Darling for k samples), and scipy.stats.ranksums (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon for 2 samples). My significance threshold to say that two samples are significantly different from each other is p = 0.01.
If these three tests return extremely low p-values (sometimes like 10^-30 or lower), then do I need to worry about something having gone wrong with the scipy functions? Are these ridiculously small p-values reliable, and can I just report p << 0.01 (p much less than my threshold)?",Extremely low p-values from non-parametric tests,"You do not need to worry about something going wrong with the scipy functions.  P values that low just mean that it's really unlikely that your samples have the same parent populations.

50396,"I have 10 different IP cameras that I need to access in a FLASK server.
I would like to know the best way to do that.
Currently, I have a dictionary that uses an ID to map to a VideoCapture object. A client sends the cam ID to the server and the server accesses the video capture object and returns a captured frame via the read function.
So technically I have 10 different objects of VideoCapture. Another method that I have used is, that upon getting camera ID, if the current cam ID is different from the received cam ID, then the video cap object is replaced with a new one.
My question is that is opening 10 video captures at one time fine? My server should be time sensitive. Does opening 10 captures congest the network? If yes then should I stick to the one object approach that always creates a new object on ID change or is there any better way to do this? Thank you.",OpenCV Capturing multiple RTSP Streams - Python,"The first way you used is OK. For every camera, you should keep one capture object. It will work faster than replacing one capture object with multiple connections. If you open RTSP connection, then it will not congest the network until you start reading frames. So you can go with the first way.
Opening and then releasing one capture object for multiple connections will slow down the speed because in every new connection it needs time to access the camera."
60093,"I have a question regarding the usage of EFS as and additional memory location for lambda. I am using python along with pandas to perform some tests on my files. And it works great if the files are not that large, but if the files exceed 2-3 GB lambda dies because of the memory limitation (using both max memory and time of lambda). Files are originally located at S3 and I was wondering would it be possible to use EFS in this scenario? If so what would be required for this solution. Would I need to transfer files from S3 to EFS in order to open them?, or is there an better solution where I can directly load the files from S3 to EFS and open them with pandas. And also there is the timeout limitation, but I hope that wont be an issues if the lambda would be faster with EFS.",Using EFS with AWS Lambda (memory issue),"As far as I know pandas requires the whole file to fit into memory.
In principle you can fit larger files into memory in Lambda, since you can now configure Lambda functions with up to 10GB of RAM.
That's doesn't translate to you being able to read a 10GB file from S3 and create a dataframe out of it, because in order for pandas to parse the data, it needs to either be stored on disk (of which there's only 500MB available to you) or in memory.
If you download the file into memory, it also takes up it's size in system memory and then you can create a pandas data frame from that. Pandas data structures are probably larger than the raw bytes of the file, so my guess is that you can load a file from S3 into memory and turn that into a data frame that is about 30-40% of the memory capacity of the lambda function.
If you store that file on EFS, you'll be able to fit more into memory, because pandas can read the bytes from disk, so you could probably squeeze out a few more gigabytes. These I/O operations take time however and Lambda is limited to at most 15 minutes of runtime. You probably also need to write that data somewhere which takes time as well.
Bottom line: Loading larger files than that into Lambda is probably not a good idea. If you can, break up the dataset into smaller chunks and have lambda functions work on them in parallel or choose a service like Athena or EMR or Glue ETL, which are built to handle that stuff."

Since it seems that a Burlap lib for Python simply doesn't exist (at least anymore), your best choice is probably to make a small Java proxy that communicates with a more recent protocol with the Python side and in Burlap with the Java server."
